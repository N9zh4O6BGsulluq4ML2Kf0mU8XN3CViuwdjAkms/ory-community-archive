<p>Hello,<br/>
im a little confused about all these products from ory. Actually i have a relative simple setup:<br/>
Im using Firebase in Angular for Login/Register to get a JWToken with customclaims “<a href="mailto:X-Hasura-User-Id=xyz@abc.de">X-Hasura-User-Id=xyz@abc.de</a>” and “X-Hasura-User-Roles=user” which Hasura needs to authorize the request.</p>
<p>Serverside i’m also using Caddy as proxy for Letsencrypt-Certificates in front of Hasura.</p>
<p>Now i want to get rid of Firebase for Authentication and want to replace it with i think OathKeeper.</p>
<p>What i need is the following:<br/>
An API to login/register/password-reset/etc to get an JWT-Token with custom claims to handle requests to hasura.</p>
<p>Am i right that it would be as following:<br/>
Login/Register with an API from OathKeeper which gives me back a cookie.<br/>
The Hasura-Requests from the frontend then are made with this cookie to OathKeeper, which are forwarded with a JWT to Hasura?</p>
<p>And can i use Caddy in this scenario in front of OathKeeper?</p>
<p>I am a bit confused if this is the right direction.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for a short help!!!</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>OauthKeeper is just a proxy and does not store users &amp; credentials.</p>
<p>If you want to manage Identity-Lifecycle (login/register/pass reset) then you should use Kratos for that.</p>
<p>You can use OauthKeeper (in conjunction with Kratos) to check if user is authenticated and if so  propagate the required header to your protected services)</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>User register &amp; login to Kratos (which maintain credentials in its own DB)</li>
<li>Put OauthKeeper in front of Kratos to check auth state and propagate the auth header you need for your services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best.</p>
