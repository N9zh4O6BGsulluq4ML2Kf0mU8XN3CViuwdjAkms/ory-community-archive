<p>I’m trying to figure out how to handle guest identities using Krakos.</p>
<p>By ‘guest identity’, I mean a unique, unshared identity, to allow users to use a service before committing to creating an account.</p>
<p>There are two use cases for this kind of flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>frictionless trial with upgrade to account, keeping data</li>
<li>Guest checkout with the option to create an account afterwards</li>
</ol>
<p>The way I’m imagining handling this with Kratos is using a custom server registration API that returns/stores an autogenerated identifier/password in the session.  At this point, only the session owner can choose to upgrade the account (or an admin, in the case of customer support).</p>
<p>Using a custom server-side registration API means having to handle CSRF manually.  Is there a better way to handle this?</p>

<p>I guess you would create a temporary profile, for example in the user’s cookie, and when the user signs up pre-populate the registration fields with the fields you already have. ORY Kratos does not really have a concept of an anonymous user. You could also use the Admin API to create a profile without any credentials but there is currently not a way to append credentials to it.</p>

<p>I’ll definitely be storing something like that locally, though most likely with local storage, rather than a cookie.</p>
<p>I want to keep a central database of login identities , I don’t want to have an external guest identity store, because that will make it more difficult to cleanly handle authorization.</p>
<p>I’m going to create an API endpoint to perform the user registration for me, and guest identities will have three fields: ‘username’ (identifier, most likely a uuid), ‘password’ (large and autogenerated), and ‘lookup_key’ (a user readable phrase, inspired by <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://xkcd.com/936/</a> ) that can be used by an admin to retrieve the account in a support request.</p>
