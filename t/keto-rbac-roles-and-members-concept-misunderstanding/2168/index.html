<p>I’ve struggling to setup my roles and policies correctly to achieve my goal.  My understanding is as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a role</li>
<li>Add members to role</li>
<li>Created a policy with subject set to roleId</li>
</ol>
<p>Now my issue</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Call the “allowed API”</li>
</ol>
<p>Where do I include member id?</p>
<p>When I call the API with the subject being equal to the roleId, it is never checking the member id.</p>
<p>Does this mean before calling the “allowed API”, I first need to call “GET role API” to see if the user has the role?</p>
<p>I was under the impressed this would be apart of Keto, as it seems counter intuitive for me to responsible for this.</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance,<br/>
Aaron</p>

<p>Are you still stuck on this? Adding a member to a role means you can just pass the role ID to the Allowed API. No need to pass the member subject directly.</p>
<p>Keto will know that subject is a member of that role.</p>
