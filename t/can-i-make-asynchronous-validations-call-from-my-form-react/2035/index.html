<p>I had a scenario where a user was registering a company and i have to validate if the company name is already taken, previously I used to debounce and check with my API if the typed in name existed. How would one solve similar issues</p>

<p>That’s a good question! This will require a bit of work on your part, especially if you save the company as part of the identity’s traits. Basically what you would have to do is implement an HTTP endpoint in your e.g. NodeJS application. That endpoint uses the ORY Kratos <code>GET /identities</code> to fetch all the identities and check their company values. If you find a duplicate, you would then disallow it.</p>
<p>Currently search is not implemented why you would need such a workaround. Another alternative is of course to just store the company not in Kratos but in your own system.</p>
