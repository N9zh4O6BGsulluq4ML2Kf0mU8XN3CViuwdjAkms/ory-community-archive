<p>I’m working on reworking our APIs to work better with the Oathkeeper / Zero Trust model. The biggest pain point for me so far has been figuring out how to allow <em>filtering</em> based on access.</p>
<p>For example, taking an example from the Keto docs, let’s use blog posts. I want to restrict access based on resource definitions like <code>blogpost:1</code>, <code>blogpost:2</code>, <code>blogpost:3</code>, and use policies like <code>blogpost:*</code>.</p>
<p>That’s great, but what if I want to only allow users to see a specific subset of these? From an access control perspective, that’s easy: just add each individual post ID / a pattern to the user’s policy / role.</p>
<p>From a UI perspective, I’m not sure how to accomplish this. What would the endpoint to request access to the subset of resources look like? I wouldn’t think the frontend should just try to access every single blog post and test each individually. I’d want to hide posts that the user does not have access to.</p>
<p>Based on Keto’s available APIs, the best thing I could come up with is <code>GET /blogposts/group</code>, using the group in the URL to have Oathkeeper use in the required resource like <code>blogpost:{group}:*</code>. This would mean I’d have to store a list of groups for each blog post in our database and filter queries based on that list.</p>
<p>That makes it a little better in a way, but it still doesn’t allow me to simply list all blog posts a user has access to. Maybe the user has access to several of these custom-made “blog post access groups”.</p>
<p>Would I have to have an API that checks the Keto Allowed API for each unique group?</p>
<p>What is the best way to solve something like this?</p>
