<p>Hi! I’m new to Hydra/ORY/Oauth2 and am trying to discern if it is possible to create and configure an Oauth2 client that I create in Hydra to somehow enforce using the Google SSO flow? My current understanding is that this is not possible and that all sign in-related behavior is dealt with by ORY Kratos, but I was wondering if there was someway to potentially configure a client’s callback URL to point to Google SSO?</p>
<p>Our use case is that we want all users that authenticate via one of our Oauth2 clients to sign in via Google SSO. If I am obviously conflating 2 separate auth flows, calling that out is helpful too!</p>

<p>So you want an OAuth2 flow which uses Google as the “identity source”? Do you need your own profile management and stuff, or do you not really care about that?</p>

<p>Yeah, Google would be the identity source. Not sure what you mean by profile management. It also feels weird to me in my original suggestion of how I was thinking of setting things up since I would be making use of 2 Oauth clients, just one of those clients would be managed by Google. Seems excessive</p>
