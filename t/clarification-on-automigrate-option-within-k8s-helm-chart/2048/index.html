<p>Hi,<br/>
one ambiguity arose on <strong>automigrate</strong> option while trying to put hydra helm chart to life into some production grade k8s (meaning more than 1 pod replicas) . According to hydra docs (the part where releases specifically instruct running migrate on db initialize or upgrade). I assume <strong>migrate</strong> is not idempotent operation and as such I see not safe to put  into initContainer.</p>
<p>Or am I wrong and operation is safe to run on every redeploy(i.e. at hydra upgrades) and all replicas in k8s cluster? Seems initContainer logs suggest this - observed at hands on test - i.e. redeploy to same hydra version gives information on 0 changes to be performed in db and initContainer exits successfully:<br/>
The following migration is planned:<br/>
| DRIVER | MODULE | ID | # |        QUERY         |<br/>
|--------|--------|----|—|----------------------|<br/>
|--------|--------|----|—|----------------------|<br/>
Successfully applied 0 SQL migrations!</p>
<p>Or it is expected to toggle option enabled manually only at explicit systemOps intention as release instructs?</p>
<p>Or even more conservative - doing migrate only from some ‘outside k8s’ hydra instance and also not ‘live’?</p>
<p>If this last is true, what about using helm hooks (pre-install, pre-upgrade) and run <strong>migrate</strong> as a job?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance and kind regards</p>

<p>It is safe to run migrate more than once on the same DB snapshot. I’m not 100% sure if there could be an issue where to migrate commands run concurrently and both try to migrate the DB - this might cause some issues.</p>
<p>In general all of that really depends on your environment. Of course, manual “outside-of-cluster” upgrades are probably ops best practice because it allows you to do backups before and remedy any issues right away (because of the manual step). A manual step does not necessarily have to run on a dev machine, it could also be in the CI with some manual job approval of some sort.</p>
<p>So it’s really up to you and your requirements.</p>
